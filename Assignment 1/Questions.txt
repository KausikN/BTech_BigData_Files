A. Develop a complete statistical package supporting features for 
           1. Descriptive Analytics
            2. Predictive Analytics
 As a part of your project, you are expected to test drive all preprocessing concepts and descriptive analytics mechanisms with respected to your assigned dataset (details given in excel sheet). Further to completion of 1 & 2, you may test drive any 2 algorithms for FIM, CFI, MFI, LFI. Also use the patterns generated from any one of the itemsets to mine interesting rules.

B. Explore various online resources to identify other measures of rules and pattern evaluation. Test drive these various measures for any one of the above itemset types.

C. Test drive Decision tree, Bayes Classification using appropriate packages from libraries in the platform of your choice. Also, construct confusion matrix and evaluate the performance of your classifier.  You may choose any open source dataset for classification.

4. A car company wants to predict how much fuel different cars will use based on their masses. 
They took a sample of cars, drove each car 100km, and measured how much fuel was used in each case (in litres). 
Visualize the data using scatterplot and also find co-relation between the 2 variables 
(eg. Positive//Negative, Linear/ Non-linear co-relation) The data is summarized in the table below.  
(Use a reasonable scale on both axes and put the explanatory variable on the x-axis.) 
Fuel used 
(L)                     3.6 6.7 9.8 11.2 14.7 
Mass (metric tons)      0.45 0.91 1.36 1.81 2.27
